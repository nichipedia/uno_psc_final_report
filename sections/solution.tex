\section{Solution}
To solve the problems defined in the previous section we developed a parallel framework for grid statistic computation.
This framework abstracts the parallelization from the statistics computation. 
The framework was implemented with MPI, OpenMP, and Java threads.
Dynamic IO is used so that reading and writing large grids can be scaled in either direction.

\par 
Abstracting parallelization behind a frameork provides a simple solution for quickly generating grid statistics.
The framework can determine the appropriate ussage of resources on the machine to quickly generate grids.
The user is left to be converned with the statistics.
This abstraction works well as it allows the user to implement or edit exsisting statistics in a quick way.

\par
The large grid size is a limiting factor for machines without copious resources.
Using dynamic IO solves this issue.
Essentially, read and writes are buffered so that only needed data is read in when required.
This implementation worked very well. 
For example, the Java threads implementation used the Java NIO package with natively supports file buffering.
